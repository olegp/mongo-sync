# Mongo Sync

Mongo Sync is a synchronous MongoDB driver for use with [Common Node](http://olegp.github.com/common-node/) that attempts to closely approximate the [MongoDB shell](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/dbshell+Reference).

It is a thin wrapper around the official MongoDB driver for Node. Here is a quick usage example that you can use with Common Node:

```javascript
    var Server = require("mongo-sync").Server;
    var Client = require("mongo-sync").MongoClient;
    var server = new Server('127.0.0.1');
    var client = new Client(server)
    var result = client.db("test").getCollection("posts").find().toArray();
    console.log(result);
    server.close();
```

For a complete application using this driver, check out [Notes](https://github.com/olegp/notes/). 

If you want to use Mongo Sync directly with [node-fibers](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers) (i.e. without Common Node), make sure all database requests occur within a fiber, e.g.:

```javascript
    var Fiber = require('fibers');
    Fiber(function() {
      // set up goes here ...
      var result = server.db("LashDB").getCollection("users").find().toArray();
    }).run();
```

### Tests

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/olegp/mongo-sync.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/olegp/mongo-sync)

Run the unit tests with the following command:

```javascript
    common-node test/test.js
```

or using Fibers
```javascript
    node test/test-fiber.js
```

### Community

If you have any questions about using `mongo-sync` by itself or in conjunction with Common Node, please post them to the [Common Node mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/common-node).
